#Week 3 - Python Challenge

This week we learned about Python in which we learnt about List, Tuples, Dictionaries, how to import libraries into python which can help during coding.
We had activities throughout this week, where we had to build a code base on an input which would determine the output of the code. 
some prior VBA skills came into play this week, such as loops and variables.  

This task was completed using Python and Jupyter Lab.


## Project Overview
The 'Pybank" project involved importing mouleds, opening csv files, creating loops to find the count of months, the profit and loss total so we could do further calculations. 
Both these calculations were then used to get the Average, increase and de-crease along with which month had increased more or de-creased less. 

Looking at the below data, there are a total off 86 however of the course of these months the average change was a negative -8,311.11

'Pypoll' project started out the same by importing the mouldes, opening the csv file and then creating a loop to get the count of candidates and the names of each candidate. using the names that the loop provided i was able to extra the total votes for each candidate and then the percentage of each along with the winner.

Looking at the below outlook, Diana Degette has won the voting by 369614 votes

## Resources
i struggled with gaining my knowledge from class  and google was my best friend, I did have wonderful help from Mark a tutor on Sunday in which she help me understood the coding we needed for pybank. 
below are some of my websites that I got heaps of knowledge and codes from. 
I did also have help from Slack and my TA was able to help to point me in the right direction with my code.
